Choosing the right lawyer is probably one of the most important decisions you'll make in your Drug Law matter.

Drug matters frequently result in applications to the courts for remedies under the Charter of Rights, involving issues of unreasonable search and seizure, arbitrary arrest and detention, the right to counsel, and the exclusion of evidence.
<br>
<br>
Mr. Lazin has conducted in excess of 1,500 trials, hearings, and contested Charter applications.

If you are facing a serious Drug Law matter, you should look for an experienced Drug Law lawyer, who has knowledge of the particular issues involved in your case. Not all Criminal Law lawyers have experience in Drug Law matters.
