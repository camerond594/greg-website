Choosing the right lawyer is probably one of the most important decisions you'll make in your Family Law matter.

Many people start their search for help with a Family Law matter with a referral from a friend or another lawyer. However, you should still ensure that any lawyer you choose has enough experience to handle your case.

Many lawyers advertise themselves as "Family Law" Lawyers. However, Family Law is an area of law that involves complex legal principles, which take time and experience to learn. Tactical decisions can have huge repercussions, and the right lawyer advising you is absolutely essential.

If you have a very simple case, with minimal financial issues and no children, you may feel comfortable hiring a less experienced General Practitioner. However, if you are facing a contested divorce case that involves substantial assets, complicated financial questions, or a complex custody dispute, you should look for an experienced Family Law lawyer, who has experience with the particular issues involved in your case.
